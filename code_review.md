Looks good, Kyle!

Just some quick thoughts:
  * Couple of spots where indentation was off (it's ok, I do this all the time as well)
  * When using strong parameters, it's cleaner to have the parameter filtering be a private method within your controller than
    in-line
  * You might want to think about edge cases when using the `destroy` method to destroy a record
  * To define class methods within a class defintion, prefix the method definition with the keyword `self` 

You can find my comments in your controllers and models.  Since we focused on backend development, I didn't review views.

All in all looks great.  Great job and good luck moving forward!
